# FileLinker - Manage Files with Ease

Tired of not able to get the files needed while giving an exam or not wanting to sign-in to Google Drive just to access a file on a stranger system ?

So, was I. 

This is FileLinker. You can upload the files and images, write messages and share them to yourself or your friends.

They are also accessible to you through a personal dashboard and you decide which files you want to share and which you don't. :)
